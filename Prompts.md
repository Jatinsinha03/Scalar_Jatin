## 🔍 Understanding the Problem
**AI Prompt:**
> "Before we dive into solving the problem, let's break it down step by step. What is the problem asking you to find? Can you rephrase it in your own words?"

💡 **Purpose:** Encourages users to internalize the problem rather than just copying the question.

---

## 🧠 Identifying Constraints & Edge Cases
**AI Prompt:**
> "What constraints are given in the problem? Are there any limitations on input size, value ranges, or specific conditions that you need to consider?"

> "Can you think of any special cases where the solution might behave unexpectedly? For example, what happens if the input array is empty or contains only one element?"

💡 **Purpose:** Helps users think about **problem constraints** and **corner cases** before jumping into implementation.

---

## 🚀 Building Intuition with Real-World Analogies
**AI Prompt:**
> "Let's relate this problem to a real-world scenario. Imagine you are at a store, and you need to find two products that add up to a certain price. How would you do it efficiently without checking every possible combination?"

💡 **Purpose:** Uses **analogies** to simplify abstract **DSA concepts**.

---

## 📊 Discussing Possible Approaches
**AI Prompt:**
> "How would you approach this problem using brute force? Can you write a simple algorithm that checks every possible combination?"

> "Now, think about optimizing it. Is there a way to avoid unnecessary comparisons? Can you use a data structure like a hash table or a sorting technique to speed up the process?"

💡 **Purpose:** Encourages users to compare **brute force vs optimized solutions**.

---

## 💻 Guiding Users Toward Code Implementation
**AI Prompt:**
> "Let's structure the solution step by step before writing code. What would be the input and output of your function? Can you define it in plain English?"

> "Now, let's write pseudocode before jumping into actual implementation. How would you translate your plan into simple logical steps?"

💡 **Purpose:** Encourages **structured thinking** before implementation.

---

## 🏎 Optimizing the Solution
**AI Prompt:**
> "Your current solution works, but can we improve it? What is the time complexity of your approach? Can you reduce it from O(n²) to O(n) or O(log n)?"

> "Are there alternative ways to solve this problem using different algorithms or data structures? Could sorting, dynamic programming, or greedy techniques help?"

💡 **Purpose:** Introduces **big-O complexity analysis** and **alternative methods**.

---

## 🏆 Common Pitfalls & Debugging
**AI Prompt:**
> "Many developers make mistakes when solving this type of problem. Can you identify what might go wrong in an incorrect implementation?"

> "What test cases would you use to verify your solution? Have you considered edge cases such as duplicate values, negative numbers, or large inputs?"

💡 **Purpose:** Develops **debugging skills** and encourages **self-checking**.

---

## 🔄 Encouraging Reflection & Learning
**AI Prompt:**
> "If you were to explain this solution to a friend who is new to programming, how would you do it? Can you summarize your understanding in a few sentences?"

> "What key takeaways did you learn from solving this problem? Do you see how this problem connects with other similar problems you've solved before?"

💡 **Purpose:** Reinforces **learning** through **self-explanation**.

# 📚 Example Problem Walkthrough: Two Sum
To show how these prompts work in practice, let’s consider **"Two Sum"** from LeetCode.

## **Example Flow with AI Prompts**
1. **AI:** *"Can you explain the problem in your own words?"*
   - *User:* "I need to find two numbers in an array that add up to a target."

2. **AI:** *"What constraints are given? Can there be multiple solutions?"*
   - *User:* "The input is an array of integers, and there is exactly one solution."

3. **AI:** *"How would you solve this using a brute force approach?"*
   - *User explains brute force approach (O(n²)).*

4. **AI:** *"Can you optimize it using a hash table? What would be the time complexity?"*
   - *User realizes that a hash table reduces complexity to O(n).*

5. **AI:** *"What test cases should we check to ensure correctness?"*
   - *User thinks about edge cases like duplicate numbers, negative numbers, etc.*

6. **AI:** *"Great job! What did you learn from solving this problem?"*
   - *User reflects on key insights.*
